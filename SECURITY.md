## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our application during the alpha development stage, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly. Please follow these guidelines to report security issues to us:

### Reporting Process

1. **Email:** Send an email to [ihsansimsek5335@gmail.com](mailto:ihsansimsek5335@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
2. **Subject:** Use the subject line `Security Vulnerability Report - Movie Collection Visualizer`
3. **Provide Information:** Include information such as the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, potential impact, and any other relevant details.
4. **Do Not Disclose Publicly:** Please avoid disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and provide a fix.

## Future Security Updates

As the application progresses beyond the alpha stage, a more comprehensive security policy will be established. This will include a responsible disclosure process, a defined schedule for security updates, and additional security measures as needed.

## Additional Notes

- Security considerations are crucial to us, even in the early stages of development.
- Your cooperation in reporting security vulnerabilities responsibly is highly valued.

*This security policy is subject to updates as the application evolves.*
